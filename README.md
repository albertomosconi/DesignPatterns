<h1 align="center">Design Patterns</h1>
<p align="center"> A Collection of Design Patterns examples in Java</p>
<br> 

To start exploring all the different examples [navigate to this folder](./src/it/albertomosconi/designpatters "open this folder"). 

You will see a list of all the implemented patterns, with a brief description. Each folder contains the example files, a README with an explanation of the pattern taken from Wikipedia, the UML diagramm and a specific description of the example.

If you want to see the output of an example, clone the repo and execute the main function. This will prompt you with a shell you can use to choose a pattern to run.
