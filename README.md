## About
This is a little personal project created with the goal of learning Design Patters in Java. It is by no means a professional guide.
I took these examples from [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc "this course") on Youtube.

## Getting Started

javac 12.0.2
```

```
git clone https://github.com/albertomosconi/design-patterns.git
