# Implementation Examples
Each folder contains a possible implementation for the corresponding Design Pattern.

- [Abstract Factory Pattern](./abstractfactory) provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
- [Adapter Pattern](./adapter) allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
- [Bridge Pattern](./bridge) is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four.
- [Command Pattern](./command) is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
- [Composite Pattern](./composite) describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object.
- [Decorator Pattern](./decorator) allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- [Facade Pattern](./facade) is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.
- [Factory Method Pattern](./factorymethod) is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
- [Iterator Pattern](./iterator) is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.
- [Null Object Pattern](./nullobject) describes the uses of objects with no referenced value or with defined neutral ("null") behavior.
- [Observer Pattern](./observer) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
- [Proxy Pattern](./proxy) is a class functioning as an interface to something else.
- [Singleton Pattern](./singleton) restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
- [State Pattern](./state) allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- [Strategy Pattern](./strategy) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- [Template Method Pattern](./templatemethod) is a method in a superclass, usually an abstract superclass, and defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a number of high-level steps.
