# Implementation Examples
Each folder contains a possible implementation for the corresponding Design Pattern.

- [Abstract Factory Pattern](./abstractfactory) provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
- [Command Pattern](./command) is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
- [Decorator Pattern](./decorator) allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- [Factory Method Pattern](./factorymethod) is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
- [Observer Pattern](./observer) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
- [Singleton Pattern](./singleton) restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
- [Strategy Pattern](./strategy) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
